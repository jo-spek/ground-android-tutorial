Welcome to OpenForis Ground!
===================================

The **GROUND Android app** is a tool for data collection in the field. With GROUND, geodata can
be recorded in the form of single points as well as polygons. These can be complemented with custom
tasks and questions during survey design in the GROUND web console, which will then be answered by
data collectors in the field. Find the OpenForis GROUND website `here <https://openforis.org/solutions/ground/>`_.

Check out the :doc:`usage` section for further information, including
how to :ref:`installation` the project.
